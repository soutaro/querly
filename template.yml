      Use block to read/write file

      If you use block, the open method closes file implicitly.
      You don't have to close files explicitly.
    examples:
      - before: |
          io = File.open("foo.txt")
          io.write("hello world")
          io.close
        after: |
          File.open("foo.txt") do |io|
            io.write("hello world")
          end

    pattern: Exception
    message: |
      You probably should use StandardError

      If you are trying to define error class, inherit that from StandardError.
    justification:
      - You are sure you want to define an exception which is not rescued by default
    examples:
      - before: class MyError < Exception; end
        after: class MyError < StandardError; end

    message: |
      Comparing size of something with 0 can be written using assert_empty
    examples:
      - before: |
